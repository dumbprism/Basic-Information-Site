The sole purpose of creating this was to learn how to deploy static HTML pages into the server and also creating a server using Node.js and also express. 

The `server.js` file consists node.js approach on how to create a server and how the server interacts with the pages and responds. 
The `express.js` file consits express.js approach on creating and using a server (recommended)

With this I conclude it is much easier to build apps using express since you have to write very minimal code and also it is quite easy compared to node. Yet it is essential to learn node.js to build basics and go ahead with express.
